Changes Needed in Current System

### 1. CSV Template Updates
Add these columns to your CSV template:
- `RSA_PIN` (Employee's Retirement Savings Account number)
- `VOLUNTARY_PENSION` (Optional amount for additional contributions)
- `EMPLOYER_PENSION_RATE` (Default 10%, can be higher if employer covers employee portion)

### 2. Salary Component Calculations
Your current system already handles basic salary and allowances. For pension calculations:

1. Pensionable Earnings Base:
   - Use Basic Salary + Housing Allowance + Transport Allowance
   - These components are already in your system

2. When to Apply Pension:
   - Only for full-time employees (check 'CONTRACT_TYPE')
   - Skip if monthly salary is below â‚¦30,000
   - Apply after calculating gross but before tax

### 3. Calculation Flow Updates
Your current process_employee() function should calculate pensions in this order:

1. Calculate monthly gross (existing)
2. Calculate pension components:
   - Employee contribution (8% of pensionable earnings)
   - Employer contribution (10% minimum)
   - Voluntary contribution (if provided in CSV)
3. Calculate taxable income (gross minus mandatory pension)
4. Calculate PAYE (existing)
5. Deduct voluntary pension (if any)
6. Calculate final net pay

### 4. Results Display Updates
Add these columns to your results table:
```
PENSION DEDUCTIONS
- Mandatory Employee Pension
- Employer Pension Contribution
- Voluntary Pension (if applicable)
```

## Integration with Existing Components

### Main File (main.py)
Add pension configuration options in the sidebar:
- Toggle for employer-funded pension (18-20% employer contribution)
- Option to enable/disable voluntary pension processing

### Salary Calculator Class
Add these pension-specific calculations between your gross and tax calculations:

1. Before Tax:
   - Calculate mandatory pension (8%)
   - Reduce taxable base by this amount

2. After Tax:
   - Process voluntary pension if present
   - Deduct from net pay

### Validation Requirements (utils.py)
Add validations for:
- RSA PIN format (if provided)
- Voluntary pension amount (cannot exceed 1/3 of monthly salary)
- Employer pension rate (must be 10% minimum)

## Example Output
Your current CSV output should expand to include:
```
EMPLOYEE_ID, GROSS_PAY, MANDATORY_PENSION, EMPLOYER_PENSION, 
VOLUNTARY_PENSION, TAXABLE_PAY, PAYE, NET_PAY
```
