# Pension Calculation Guide for Payroll System

## Understanding Pension Contributions

### 1. Mandatory Employee Contribution (8%)
The calculator should deduct 8% from the employee's monthly emoluments, which includes:
- Basic salary
- Housing allowance
- Transport allowance

This is a pre-tax deduction, meaning it reduces the employee's taxable income.

### 2. Employer Contribution (10% minimum)
- The employer must contribute at least 10% of the same monthly emoluments
- Some employers may choose to pay the full 18% (covering both employee and employer portions)
- This doesn't affect the employee's net pay calculation but must be shown on the payslip

### 3. Voluntary Contribution
- This is an optional extra contribution from the employee's salary
- It's limited to a maximum of 1/3 of the monthly salary
- This is a post-tax deduction (comes after tax calculation)
- Must be tracked separately from mandatory contributions

## How It Should Appear on the Payslip

### 1. Mandatory Pension Section
```
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS
Employee Contribution (8%):    ₦XX,XXX.XX
Employer Contribution (10%):   ₦XX,XXX.XX
Total Mandatory Pension:       ₦XX,XXX.XX
```

### 2. Voluntary Pension Section (if applicable)
```
VOLUNTARY PENSION
Voluntary Contribution:        ₦XX,XXX.XX
```

### 3. Net Pay Calculation Order
1. Start with gross pay (basic + housing + transport + other allowances)
2. Deduct 8% mandatory pension
3. Calculate tax on the remaining amount
4. Deduct voluntary contribution (if any)
5. Show final net pay

## Important Rules to Remember

1. Minimum Wage Exception
- If monthly salary is below ₦30,000, no pension deduction applies

2. Timing Requirements
- All pension deductions must be remitted within 7 days of salary payment

3. Documentation Requirements
- Each employee needs a Retirement Savings Account (RSA) PIN
- Monthly contribution records must be maintained

## Sample Calculation Example

For an employee earning ₦300,000 monthly (basic: ₦200k, housing: ₦70k, transport: ₦30k):

1. Calculate pensionable earnings:
   - Total = ₦300,000

2. Calculate mandatory deductions:
   - Employee contribution (8%) = ₦24,000
   - Employer contribution (10%) = ₦30,000

3. Calculate taxable income:
   - ₦300,000 - ₦24,000 = ₦276,000

4. If there's a voluntary contribution:
   - Maximum allowed = ₦100,000 (1/3 of monthly salary)
   - This comes out after tax calculation
