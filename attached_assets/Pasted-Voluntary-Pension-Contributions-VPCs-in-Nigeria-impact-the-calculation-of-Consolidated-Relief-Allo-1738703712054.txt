Voluntary Pension Contributions (VPCs) in Nigeria impact the calculation of Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA) by altering the **gross income** used to compute taxable income. Here’s a breakdown of the interaction:

### 1. **Effect on Gross Income for CRA**  
Under the **Finance Act 2021**, pension contributions (including VPCs) are excluded from gross income when calculating CRA[4][7][15]. This means:  
- **Adjusted gross income** = Gross income – (statutory deductions + VPCs).  
- CRA is then calculated as **20% of adjusted gross income + ₦200,000 (or 1% of gross income, whichever is higher)**.  

For example, with a monthly salary of ₦500,000 and a VPC of ₦50,000:  
- Adjusted gross income = ₦500,000 – ₦50,000 = ₦450,000.  
- CRA = 20% of ₦450,000 + ₦200,000 = ₦90,000 + ₦200,000 = ₦290,000.  

### 2. **Tax Relief vs. CRA Reduction**  
While VPCs reduce the base for CRA’s 20% component, they provide **direct tax relief**:  
- VPCs are **tax-deductible**, lowering taxable income further[10][11].  
- Example: If annual VPC is ₦600,000, taxable income reduces by this amount *before* applying CRA[3][10].  

This creates a trade-off:  
- A smaller CRA (due to lower adjusted gross income).  
- A larger tax deduction from the VPC itself.  

### 3. **Withdrawal Rules and Tax Implications**  
- **Withdrawals within 5 years**: Income earned on VPCs is taxed[1][12][16].  
- **Withdrawals after 5 years**: Both principal and income are tax-free[12][19].  
- For mandatory contributors, 50% of VPCs are locked until retirement[2][19].  

### Practical Example  
| **Parameter**       | **Without VPC**      | **With VPC (₦50,000/month)** |  
|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Gross income         | ₦6,000,000            | ₦6,000,000                    |  
| VPC deduction        | –                     | ₦600,000                      |  
| Adjusted gross income| ₦6,000,000            | ₦5,400,000                    |  
| CRA                  | ₦1,400,000            | ₦1,280,000                    |  
| Taxable income       | ₦4,600,000            | ₦4,520,000                    |  

**Net effect**: Despite a lower CRA, the VPC’s direct deduction reduces taxable income further, often resulting in **greater overall tax savings**[10][11].  

### Key Takeaway  
VPCs reduce CRA by lowering the gross income base but provide proportional tax relief through deductions. The strategy is most beneficial for long-term savers who avoid early withdrawals (to prevent income taxation)[12][19]. Employers and employees should ensure compliance with PenCOM’s guidelines on contribution limits (e.g., VPCs cannot exceed 1/3 of monthly salary)[2][7].
